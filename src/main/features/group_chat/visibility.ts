/**
 * Group-chat visibility — per-actor message slices.
 *
 * Bus calls `appendVisible` for every newly-emitted group message. The slice
 * is the agent worker's source of truth: when its session is first created
 * (worker startup or after eviction), `replaySliceIntoSession` reads the
 * jsonl and feeds the entries into the PersistentSession so the LLM picks
 * up where it left off.
 *
 * Visibility rule per actor (also documented in CLAUDE.md §5):
 *   commander → every group message
 *   agent X   → messages where X is in {from, to, mentions} OR
 *               (from == commander && to includes X)
 *   user      → reads `<cid>.jsonl` directly; no slice file

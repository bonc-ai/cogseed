/**
 * Shared classifier for "transient network-class error" vs everything else.
 *
 * Two consumers as of 2026-05-20:
 *   - `features/group_chat/plan_executor.ts::maybeRetryTransient` — caps
 *     plan-step retries to network blips, NEVER retries permanent errors
 *     (would mask config / spec / sandbox issues + send the user-facing
 *     failure bubble into a silent retry loop).
 *   - `features/expert_signals/turn_hooks.ts::SkillTurnBuffer.drainAndEmit`
 *     — `skill_ineffective` is only emitted when a turn's errText is
 *     non-transient, so we don't blame skills for network blips.
 *
 * IMPORTANT — never include `aborted` or `cancelled` in this pattern:
 * user-initiated abort must not be silently retried; the literal string
 * `'aborted by user'` is also explicitly excluded by the guard at the
 * caller site (see `plan_executor.ts::maybeRetryTransient`).
 *
 * Pattern is intentionally scoped to provider transport / gateway failures:
 * undici / fetch / DNS / socket-layer signals, stream drops, request/header
 * timeouts, rate-limit throttles, upstream 5xx families, and local CLI
 * watchdog kills (`exceeded <N>ms` / `no activity for <N>ms` — see
 * `local_agents/backends/base.ts::armKillWatchdog`; retrying those resumes
 * the CLI's persisted session, so the killed turn's context is not lost).
 * Spec-missing /
 * LLM gibberish / parse failures / sandbox rejections are all permanent by
 * construction — they don't go away on retry, and they ARE the failures where
 * a loaded skill might have misled the model (the signal that
 * `skill_ineffective` exists to catch).

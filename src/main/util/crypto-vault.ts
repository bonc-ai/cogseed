/**
 * Open-source fallback / legacy local-file encryption.
 *
 * Design intent — **obfuscation, not security**: the key is derived deterministically from a
 * compiled-in app salt + a caller-provided seed, so anyone who runs Orkas can decrypt their own
 * files when they know the seed context. It is NOT keychain-protected, deliberately — see
 * PC/CLAUDE.md §6.5 OAuth section for the reasoning (portability + no OS-keystore dependency
 * trade-off the product owner accepted).
 *
 * What this protects against:
 *   - Files accidentally syncing to a cloud backup that runs OCR / text indexing on them.
 *   - Logging / crash-dump capture that incidentally reads the JSON.
 *   - Hand-inspecting the file in a text editor.
 *   - Random other apps reading `<uid>/local/config/` via filesystem permission slip-ups.
 *
 * What this does NOT protect against:
 *   - An attacker who has both the disk contents AND the Orkas binary (the derivation function
 *     is in source code → key is recoverable from `uid` alone).
 *   - Targeted forensic recovery from a stolen device.
 *
 * Hosted Orkas should normally go through `util/local-secret-store.ts`, which uses the private
 * `ORKLSEC1:` backend when available and calls this module only as an the open-source build fallback or for
 * one-shot migration of older files.
 *
 * File layout written to disk:
 *
 *   `ORKVAULT1` (8 ASCII bytes) || [12B IV] || [16B GCM tag] || ciphertext
 *
 * The whole thing is base64-encoded so the file remains text (easier to ship + back up).

/**
 * Model interaction client.
 *
 * Thin wrapper over the core-agent backend — see `./core-agent/client.ts`
 * for the actual implementation. This file exists so feature code can
 * keep doing `require('../model/client')` / `import { chatWithModel } from
 * '../model/client'` with no path changes.
 *
 * Public API:
 *   - `chatWithModel(opts)`        — blocking; returns { ok, text, error }
 *   - `streamChatWithModel(opts)`  — async generator yielding SSE-shape events
 *
 * Types (`ChatOptions`, `ChatResult`, `StreamEvent`) are defined here as the
 * cross-module contract between features/ and model/.

/**
 * Read-before-edit + optimistic concurrency control (OCC) for the file tools.
 *
 * `read_file` / `write_file` stamp the file's `{ mtimeMs, size, hash? }` into a
 * run-scoped map; `edit_file` checks that stamp before it writes:
 *   - read-before-edit — refuse to edit a file the model has not read this run
 *     (its `old_string` would be a guess), and
 *   - OCC — refuse to edit a file that changed on disk since the model read it
 *     (a parallel worker, a bash command, or an external process moved it),
 *     forcing a fresh `read_file` so the edit lands on the real current bytes.
 *
 * The map lives on `ctx.state[READ_FILE_STATE_KEY]`, injected once per run by
 * core-agent's runner (so it survives across LLM rounds — read and edit are
 * always different rounds). Enforcement is gated on the map's PRESENCE: when a
 * host doesn't inject it (older runner, a unit test with `state: {}`) the file
 * tools degrade to their pre-OCC behaviour rather than blocking every edit. The
 * real runner always injects it, so production always enforces.
 *
 * Stamping from `read_file` is concurrency-safe even though `read_file` is
 * `executionMode:'parallel'`: a keyed `Map.set(abs, …)` is atomic in JS, the
 * key is the absolute path (concurrent reads of different files never collide),
 * and same-file reads write an equivalent value. Each worker run has its OWN
 * ctx.state, so cross-worker safety rests on the filesystem lock + OCC, not on
 * this map.
